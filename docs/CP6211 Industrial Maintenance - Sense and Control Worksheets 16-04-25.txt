Worksheet 1
Basic Outputs
Modern industrial control systems, including PLCs, typically
provide two types of outputs:
•

Low-current transistor outputs

•

High-current relay outputs

Transistor outputs are fast and ideal for driving signals to other
control devices. But they can’t handle much current directly.
Relay outputs, while slower due to their mechanical switching,
are robust and better suited to driving loads like pumps, solenoids, or indicator beacons found in maintenance systems.
The photograph shows a simple industrial warning beacon used in equipment status indication.

Over to you:
1. Assemble the Locktronics system
shown.
2. Load Program 1.
3. It will cycle through outputs 1 to 4,
turning each one on in sequence.
4. The LOGO! PLC's screen displays
the status of each output during
operation.

So what?

•

In industrial maintenance, understanding
the output capabilities of your PLC is essential. Transistor outputs vary between
models, so always check the voltage and current ratings before connecting equipment.
When a controller can't drive a load directly such as a motor, solenoid, or warning light
external relays are used to handle the higher current.
Even with a common ground, relays provide electrical isolation between the control
and power circuits, which is critical during fault-finding or system upgrades.
Some PLCs lack internal relays, so maintenance teams must account for this when

Worksheet 2
Sequenced Outputs
Switching between system states is a key part of
many control programs. This method is often
called a 'state machine'.
In the basic traffic light example shown here, there
are four distinct states. The system must step
through these states, assigning specific output values to control the lights.

Over to you:
1. Build the system shown opposite.
2. Load Program 2, it will control the
LEDs to simulate the behaviour of
a set of traffic lights.
3. It assigns output values for each
LED for a single state in the
sequence.
4. It uses a timer / counter to keep
track of the current state and then
add decisions into the program
based on that state.
5. It modifies the output values,
depending on the current state.

So what?
•

•

•

Control systems writing to outputs and turning them on is a basic and very important
function in control systems. This action is used often to operate equipment such as
indicator lamps, relays, or valves.
Manually switching outputs through the control system is a practical method for testing
and fault-finding. It allows you to confirm whether devices are wired correctly and
responding as expected, without relying on full system operation.
This is also useful when commissioning new panels or replacing components. Always
verify what each output controls, check terminal labels, and be cautious of load
conditions before activating any output.

Worksheet 3
Pulse Width Modulation
To vary the speed of a motor, you need to vary the
power supplied to it.
Two of the easiest ways of doing this are:
• vary the voltage applied to it;
• use Pulse Width Modulation (or PWM) and vary
the duty cycle (the ratio of ‘on’ time to ‘off’ time)
of the motor supply.

Over to you:
1. Build the system shown opposite.
2. Load Program 3, to enable PWM
on Output 1.

3. Ramp up the duty cycle from ‘fully
off’ to ‘fully on’ in small steps over
a 10 second period.
4. Do the same for Output 2.
5. The LOGO! PLCs screen shows
the status of each of the outputs
and also the current PWM percentage.

So what?
•

Motor speed is rarely adjusted by changing the supply voltage directly. Instead, control
is achieved by pulsing the output rapidly and adjusting the ratio of 'on' time to 'off' time.

•

This technique, known as Pulse Width Modulation (PWM), is efficient and widely used
for controlling motors, lighting, and other variable loads. In many systems, PWM
signals are also used as control inputs to variable frequency drives (VFDs), which then
regulate motor speed more precisely.

Worksheet 3
Pulse Width Modulation

Over to you:
1. Modify the circuit so that output 2
feeds a FET connected to a motor.
2. Is there any difference in the
functionality of the program?

So what?
•

FETs are useful current amplifiers.

•

Where a controller needs to switch
larger currents quickly, external
transistor drivers may be needed.

•

Transistors switch much faster
than relays.

•

The motor outputs of the controller
will be either simple FETs or a grid
of FETs that can both sink and
source current.
You need to understand the
internal circuitry of your controller
to understand its capabilities.

Worksheet 4
Basic Inputs
The sensors in any industrial system can be divided into
two types: analogue and digital.
Some modern controllers have separate analogue and
digital inputs. Some have inputs that can be configured
as either analogue or digital.
Digital sensors have a two-state output, usually known
as either ‘on’ or ‘off’, determined by the power supply
voltage - often 24V (on) and 0V(off).
Analogue sensors have a continuous range of output
voltages, normally between 10V and 0V. Analogue sensors are covered later in the course.
The photograph shows some industrial metal proximity
sensors.

Over to you:
1. Build the system shown opposite.
2. Load Program 4 to read the digital
state of the switches, where
‘pressed’ or ‘activated’ = ‘ON’
3. Display the state of the switches on
the corresponding outputs.
4. The LOGO! PLCs screen shows
the status of each of the inputs
this time, not the outputs.

So what?
•

The three switches operate differently, which is important to understand during
maintenance.

•

Some controllers accept both analogue and digital signals on the same input. Others
use opto-isolated inputs that only accept digital signals.

•

Always check the input type before connecting or replacing a sensor to avoid signal
errors.

Worksheet 5
Pedestrian Crossing
By combining the previous worksheets, we can now
create a fully-functional road-crossing system.
In this, the green light is on and traffic flows, until a
pedestrian presses a switch to request to cross. The
controller then turns the light from green to amber for
5 seconds, to warn motorists that a red light is
coming, and then to red to stop the traffic.
At that point, a second green light, facing the
pedestrian, flashes to show that it is clear to cross.
After 30 seconds, this turns off, the red and amber
lights come on for 5 seconds and then the lights turn
green so that traffic can flow again.
The image shows a partial flow chart for the system.

Over to you:
1. Build the system shown opposite.
2. Sketch a full flow chart for your
program.
3. Load program 5 to control the state
of the three main signal lights according to the description given
above.
4. The LOGO! PLCs screen shows
the status of each of the lights, including the pedestrian walk green
man.

So what?
•

•

This system relies heavily on timers, which are a core element in industrial control.
Timers are used to manage delays, enforce safety pauses, and coordinate the
sequence of events.
Whether you're handling traffic lights or machine operations, understanding how to
timers operate on a basic level is essential for reliable and safe system behaviour
during maintenance.

Worksheet 6
Potentiometers
A switch typically sends either a 24V or 0V signal to a controller input.
A potentiometer, on the other hand, provides a
variable voltage between 0V and 24V.
Potentiometers are useful for setting values like
light level, conveyor speed, or room temperature.
The photograph shows an electrical control
panel where potentiometers are used to set current limits.
Over to you:
1. Build the system shown opposite.
2. Measure the range of voltages provided
by the potentiometer at the controller
input.

3. Suppose that this is a heater control.
Decide on an acceptable voltage range,
say 0V to 5V.
In this range, the green LED should be
on.
For all voltages above 5V, the green
LED should be off and the red LED
should be on.
4. Load program 6 to give the controller
this functionality.

5. The LOGO! PLCs screen shows the
status of the lights and the analogue
input value.

So what?
•

In industrial maintenance, digital inputs are often enough for basic control tasks like
detecting switches or sensors. But when setting values such as motor speed, pressure
limits, or temperature targets, a variable input is required.

•

A common and simple method is to use a dial, typically a potentiometer, which allows
maintenance teams to adjust settings directly on the panel without needing to access
the software.

Worksheet 7
Using sensors
Some sensors are digital, such as the reed relay you
saw earlier, Hall effect sensors, simple level sensors
etc.
However most are analogue, their output signal varies
between 0 and 10V usually, representing a varying
quantity, light level, temperature or voltage, for example.
We can use signals from these to measure these
quantities and make control decisions.
The photograph shows a temperature control panel.

Over to you:
1. Build the system shown opposite. The
thermistor is an analogue sensor.
Touching it simulates increasing the
temperature inside the appliance.
2. Load Program 7 to sample the
temperature sensor and trigger an
alarm when the sensor increases by
1%.

4a

3. Use the switch on input 1 to take a
temperature reading.
4. Then use your fingers on the thermistor
to apply some heat. After a 1% change,
the green status LED should turn off
and the red error LED should turn on.
5. The LOGO! PLCs screen shows the
analogue input value and the alarm
status.
So what?
•
•

Being able to read and interpret analogue signals is essential in industrial maintenance. Most real-world values like temperature, pressure, and flow vary continuously.
Analogue sensors provide this information, allowing systems to respond with greater
accuracy. Understanding how these signals work helps maintenance teams troubleshoot faults, calibrate equipment, and ensure systems operate within safe and efficient
limits.

Worksheet 8
Detecting Faults 1
In modern industrial systems, controllers also
report on the status of the system and many
of its components.
In this landing gear system, the controller can
detect when the main landing gear is not fully
engaged and inform the pilot and flight control
so that they can react accordingly.
The photograph shows aircraft landing gear.

Over to you:
1. Build the system shown opposite. It
contains a resistor that allows the
current in an incandescent warning
bulb to be monitored.

2. Load Program 8 that allows you to
switch the bulb on and off using the
switch connected to I1.
3. Add an analogue sample function to
the program for I2 to detect the voltage change across the 10 resistor as current flows through it.
4. Switch on the red LED if this signal
is zero when the lamp is switched
on.
5. Test this ’broken bulb detector’ by
removing the bulb.
6. The LOGO! PLCs screen shows the
analogue input value and the fault
status.
So what?
•

In safety-critical systems, extra circuitry is often used to confirm that devices are
operating as expected.

•

One common method is placing a small resistor in line with an actuator. By measuring
the voltage across the resistor, the system can detect if current is flowing. This helps
verify that the actuator is not just being commanded, but is actually drawing power and
likely operating correctly.

Worksheet 9
Detecting Faults 2
In fault critical systems, such as industrial processes
where a fault could have catastrophic consequences, it is important to track all problems as they develop.
When using analogue sensors, it can be difficult to
detect a faulty reading. If a sensor is short-circuited
to one of the power supply rails, for example, the
input signal into the controller would still resemble a
valid signal.
The photograph shows a sheet steel machine.
Over to you:
1. Build the system shown opposite.
It contains a potentiometer which
is supplying the analogue sensor
signal.

2. Load Program 9 to:
•

read the potentiometer signal;

•

light the green LED if the signal
has a value between 50 and
200.

•

light the red LED if the signal is
outside of these values.

3.

Short-circuit input I1 to +V and
0V, in turn and check that the
system is detecting the fault correctly.

4.

The LOGO! PLCs screen shows
the analogue input value and the
fault status.

So what?
•

Well-designed circuits and control logic play a key role in ensuring equipment operates
safely and reliably. Intelligent use of inputs and monitoring can help detect faults early,
confirm devices are responding correctly, and reduce unplanned downtime. This
approach is especially important when maintaining systems that must meet strict safety
or operational standards.

Worksheet 10
Open-Loop Control
There are two principal types of control system: open loop
and closed loop. Closed loop systems have some kind of
feedback which allows for system regulation. Open loop
systems have no feedback and engineers rely on an
understanding of the components in the system to provide
the required functionality.
Photograph shows variable speed motors in a pumping
station

Over to you:
1. Build the system shown opposite.
2. Load Program 10 to read the
signal from the potentiometer
and use it to vary the speed of
the motor, using Pulse Width
Modulation.
3. The LOGO! PLCs screen shows
the analogue input value, the
PWM value and the output value.

So what?
•
•

This is an example of an open-loop control system.
Open-loop systems control outputs without feedback. They are simple but won't detect
faults like a stuck valve or failed actuator. Knowing where these are used helps identify
issues during inspections and repairs.

Worksheet 11
Closed-Loop Control
The light level sensor circuit shown below, is an
example of a closed-loop control system.
The lamp lights up its surroundings. A signal from the
light sensor indicating light level, is fed back and
compared to the desired light level, set by the
potentiometer.

The system knows when the desired light level has been
reached and can compensate for background lighting .
The photograph shows a lamp with a built-in sensor.
Over to you:
1. Build the system shown opposite.
2. Use a sheet of A4 to create a ‘room’
around the light source and sensor
and shield the system from ambient
light.
3. Characterise the voltage reading from
the light sensor for 100% bulb on to
0% LED bulb on and the stages in
between.
4. Load Program 11 so that the potentiometer is used to adjust the system
for a light level - not a PWM output
value. The program should constantly
check light level and adjust output
accordingly.
5. Use your mobile phone torch to adjust
ambient light level - when you shine
the torch on the sensor - the output to
the LED lamp should decrease.
So what?
•
•

This is a closed-loop system. The potentiometer sets the required light level and then
the controller measures and adjusts the light level to achieve that.
Closed loop systems are more effective at achieving a required result.

Maintenance Tips
Everyday Maintenance Tips for Industrial Sensors & Control Systems
In industrial systems, always keep an eye on output devices like lamps, relays, and solenoids
check for heat damage, wear, and loose wiring. If a sequence isn’t behaving as expected, timers or relay contacts might be at fault. PWM-controlled devices like motors should be monitored
for overheating, and it’s good practice to shield signal cables to avoid interference.
Inputs can fail from something as simple as a broken wire or a faulty switch, so it’s worth simulating inputs during troubleshooting. Safety systems, like those in pedestrian crossings, need to
be checked regularly especially to ensure they fail to a safe state. Potentiometers are prone to
wear and can give jumpy readings, so test them with a known resistance or replace if readings
are inconsistent.
Sensors should be kept clean and aligned, with all connectors checked for damage or looseness. Fault detection is more reliable when you simulate issues intentionally disconnect wires or
short outputs to see if alarms or indicators trigger as expected. This helps validate both hardware and software responses.
Open-loop systems can drift over time if load conditions change or actuators begin to stick, so
regular recalibration is important. Closed-loop systems offer better stability but depend heavily
on accurate sensors and well-tuned PID settings. If the system starts to oscillate or misses its
setpoint, check calibration and adjust PID values as needed.

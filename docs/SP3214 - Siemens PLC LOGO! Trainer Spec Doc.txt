Product Description
The Matrix PLC LOGO! Module introduces learners to core concepts in industrial automation
and programmable control in a compact, self-contained system. Designed around the Siemens LOGO! PLC and the versatile Locktronics platform, the module enables hands-on exploration of PLC programming, control logic, and real-world I/O systems.
The integrated LOGO! controller provides both wired and wireless connectivity, supporting
program upload via MicroSD. Students can control logic-driven outputs and view system
feedback using a PC, mobile device, or built-in display.
Experiments are built around modular components mounted to a Locktronics pillar board.
Each component such as input switches, indicator lamps, sensors, and relays is secured using
quick-release connectors for fast configuration and testing.
While the product does not come with a fixed curriculum, example programs and datasheets
are provided via SD cards for different experiment setups. We recommend using the CP6211
Industrial Maintenance – Sense and Control curriculum alongside the LOGO! Module to maximize learning outcomes. This curriculum supports exploration of control systems, input/
output devices, logic operations, and troubleshooting.
The LOGO! module is a foundational tool for building and diagnosing more advanced control
systems and is designed to integrate seamlessly with other Matrix industrial training kits.

Key Features
Matrix PLC LOGO! Module allows students to engage directly with the principles of programmable
logic control through hands-on experimentation and real-world industrial components.
Covers core automation and control topics including logic gates, timers, counters, I/O devices, and
system integration.
Base Station:
Built around the robust Locktronics platform with a steel base and durable pillar system, ideal for
classroom and workshop environments.
Features a quick-swap modular layout for attaching input/output modules, relays, and sensors using secure quick-release connectors.
Includes Siemens LOGO! PLC pre-mounted to a custom Locktronics carrier plate, enabling rapid
setup and configuration.
Data Logging / Computer Control:
Supports USB and MicroSD-based program uploads.
Features integrated web server functionality for remote HMI control via PC or mobile device over
LAN/Wi-Fi.
Compatible with Siemens LOGO! Soft Comfort software for full programming and monitoring.
Supplied with tested MicroSD card preloaded with example programs for common control experiments.
Modular Design:
The Matrix PLC LOGO! Module is built for flexibility, allowing components to be arranged on a single Locktronics board or spread across two or three boards depending on the experiment complexity.
The module clicks securely into place using Locktronics pillars, keeping the circuit layout clean and
minimizing the need for excessive wiring or wire carriers.
This approach reduces visual clutter, simplifies fault tracing, and improves student understanding
of signal paths and logic structure.
Recommended for use with the CP6211 Industrial Maintenance – Sense and Control curriculum to
explore real-world control systems, automation logic, and troubleshooting practices.
Ideal for technical education in engineering, automation, and industrial maintenance, the Matrix
PLC LOGO! Module provides a flexible and expandable platform for developing real-world skills in
PLC programming and system control.

Learning Objectives
Get real experience with a fantastic PLC the Siemens LOGO!
By the end of this course, learners will be able to:
•

Distinguish between analogue and digital sensors.

•

Understand that simple digital sensors have a two-state output: open (off) or closed (on).

•

Recognize that digital sensors exhibit high resistance when open and low resistance when
closed.

•

Identify that digital sensor outputs are typically either 0V or the full power supply voltage.

•

Recognize and understand circuit symbols for a range of switches, bulbs, and sensors.

•

Appreciate that some components are polarized and must be connected correctly.

•

Program a controller to recognize a high input voltage as an ‘on’ or ‘off’ signal.

•

Understand output device requirements in terms of current, and the use of relays for higher
current delivery.

•

Understand the advantages of transistors over relays for faster switching.

•

Connect a control unit to deliver current through transistor and relay outputs.

•

Understand systems as comprising three core elements: input, process, and output subsystems.

•

Recognize that analogue sensors provide a continuous range of voltages.

•

Use a potentiometer to set a reference voltage for parameters such as temperature.

•

Differentiate between open-loop and closed-loop control systems.

•

Simulate an analogue voltage using a square wave with a varying duty cycle (PWM).

•

Understand that analogue sensor signals may require scaling or conversion to be meaningful.

•

Program and control PLCs using different programming languages and methods.

Frequently asked questions
What software is needed to run the LOGO!?
None, you can download our example programs and drag & drop them onto the
SD card to get going immediately. You are also welcome to purchase Siemens
LOGO Soft software, this will allow you to program the PLC directly.
How many students can work with this kit?
We would suggest that one kit would comfortably fit 2 students working around it.
One is also fine.
What age is the kit aimed at?
This Industrial Maintenance PLC LOGO! Module is aimed at college and university
students, typically those aged 16-20.
Does the kit come with a curriculum?
Yes, the kit comes with a full and free curriculum, which comes with comprehensive learning, student worksheets and teacher notes. This is readily available on
the learning center.
How does the storage work?
Everything that comes with the kit can be stored within the tray the kit is shipped
with.
Does the system require mains electricity?
No we use a 24V power supply with an accompanying UK, EU and US adapter plug.
